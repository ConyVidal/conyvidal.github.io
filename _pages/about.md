I am a Ph.D. student in the Psychology department at Harvard University, under the joint supervision of Professors Randy Buckner and Leah Somerville. My doctoral research leverages mobile and wearable technology and intensive longitudinal designs to study how individuals' emotional states and behaviors like sleep and socializing change following stressful experiences. Ultimately, I seek to understand how people’s response to stressors relates to their short- and long-term health and wellbeing, and how this knowledge might inform individualized approaches to care.

I grew up in Chile, lived in Singapore for two years on a [United World College](https://www.uwc.org/) scholarship, and moved to the United States for college. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked in Harvard Professor Leah Somerville’s lab managing the Human Connectome Project in Development, a NIH-funded multimodal brain study charting age-related changes in neural network properties in children, adolescents, and adults.
