I'm a [Ph.D. candidate](https://conyvidal.github.io/research/){:target="_blank"} at Harvard University (degree expected May 2024). My doctoral research uses digital technologies and large-scale datasets to examine the dynamic impact of real-world stressors on health behaviors and emotional wellbeing.

Alongside my Ph.D., I've worked as a [science and technology policy analyst](https://conyvidal.github.io/policy){:target="_blank"} and written about emerging technologies and the domestic and global factors shaping the United States' S&T strategy for the [Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org/){:target="_blank"}. Additionally, as President of the [Harvard Science Policy Group](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/sciencepolicy/home){:target="_blank"}, I have partnered with experts to deliver programming on timely policy issues as well as to support career exploration and professional development among young scientists and engineers interested in policy.

I was recently named a [2024 Mirzayan Science and Technology Policy Fellow](https://mirzayanfellow.nas.edu/){:target="_blank"} with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Washington, D.C., where I will support the organization of cross-sectoral initiatives examining how emerging technologies can enhance health care and how policymaking can further advance S&T innovation in the United States.

I hold Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in psychology and cognitive neuroscience from Harvard University.
