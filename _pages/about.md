I'm a [science and technology policy researcher](https://conyvidal.github.io/policy){:target="_blank"} writing about emerging technologies and the domestic and global factors shaping the United States' S&T strategy for the [Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org/){:target="_blank"}. 

I was recently named a [2024 Mirzayan Science and Technology Policy Fellow](https://mirzayanfellow.nas.edu/){:target="_blank"} with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Washington, D.C., where I will support the organization of cross-sectoral initiatives seeking to leverage emerging technological innovations to advance U.S. innovation in medicine and other strategic fields.

My understanding of emerging technologies and their policy implications has been informed by my [doctoral research](https://conyvidal.github.io/research/){:target="_blank"} in digital health at Harvard University, where I used digital technologies and advanced analytics to examine the dynamic impact of real-world stressors on health behaviors and emotional wellbeing. 

During my time at Harvard, I have also served as President of the [Harvard Science Policy Group](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/sciencepolicy/home){:target="_blank"}, partnering with experts to deliver programming on timely policy issues and to support the professional development of young scientists and engineers interested in policy.

I hold Doctoral, Master’s, and Bachelor’s degrees in psychology and cognitive neuroscience from Harvard University.
