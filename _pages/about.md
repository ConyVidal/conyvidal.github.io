I'm a [science and technology policy researcher](https://conyvidal.github.io/policy){:target="_blank"}  investigating foundational and emerging technologies (semiconductors, AI, biotech) and the domestic and global factors shaping the US S&T strategy for the [Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org/){:target="_blank"}. 

As a [2024 Mirzayan Science and Technology Policy Fellow](https://mirzayanfellow.nas.edu/){:target="_blank"} with the National Academies of Sciences, I'm supporting the organization of cross-sectoral initiatives to advance U.S. innovation and workforce development in semiconductors, medicine, and other strategic fields.

My understanding of emerging technologies and their policy implications has been informed by my [doctoral research](https://conyvidal.github.io/research/){:target="_blank"} in digital health at Harvard University, where I used digital technologies and advanced analytics to examine the dynamic impact of real-world stressors on health behaviors and emotional wellbeing. 

During my time at Harvard, I served as President of the [Harvard Science Policy Group](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/sciencepolicy/home){:target="_blank"}, partnering with experts to deliver programming on timely policy issues and to support the professional development of young scientists and engineers interested in policy.

I hold Doctoral, Master’s, and Bachelor’s degrees in psychology and cognitive neuroscience from Harvard University. Across a wide range of scientific and policy initiatives, I have 8+ years of expertise leading research projects, advanced analytics, and effective communication with diverse stakeholders. 

I grew up in Chile, spent two years in Singapore on a United World College scholarship, and in my free time I enjoy running, science fiction, and learning Mandarin Chinese.
