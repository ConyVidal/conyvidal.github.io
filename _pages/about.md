I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Psychology department at Harvard University, under the joint supervision of Professors [Randy Buckner](https://cnl.rc.fas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [Leah Somerville](https://andl.wjh.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

My [doctoral research](https://conyvidal.github.io/research/){:target="_blank"} leverages mobile and wearable technology and intensive longitudinal designs to study life stress and its effects on emotions and behaviors like sleep and socializing. Ultimately, I seek to understand how people’s responses to diverse stressors relates to their short- and long-term health and wellbeing, and how this knowledge might inform individualized, precision approaches to care.

I have several years of experience [teaching statistics and advising](https://conyvidal.github.io/teaching){:target="_blank"} undergraduates in psychology. Additionally, I'm passionate about [science and technology policy](https://conyvidal.github.io/policy){:target="_blank"}, serve as President of the [Harvard Science Policy Group](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/sciencepolicy/home){:target="_blank"}, and occasionally [consult and write](https://conyvidal.github.io/policy){:target="_blank"} about various S&T policy topics, from digital technology to advanced manufacturing.           

I grew up in Chile, lived in Singapore for two years on a [United World College](https://www.uwc.org/){:target="_blank"} scholarship, and moved to the United States for college (Harvard College '16). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked in Harvard Professor Leah Somerville’s lab managing the Human Connectome Project in Development, a NIH-funded multimodal brain study charting age-related changes in brain and cognitive properties in children, adolescents, and adults.
