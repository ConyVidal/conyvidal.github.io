I am a Ph.D. student in the Psychology department at Harvard University, under the joint supervision of Professors Randy Buckner and Leah Somerville. My doctoral research leverages mobile and wearable technology and intensive longitudinal designs to study how individuals' emotional states and behaviors like sleep and socializing change following experiences of stress. Ultimately, I seek to understand how people’s response to various stressors relates to their short- and long-term health and wellbeing, and how this knowledge might inform individualized approaches to care.

I have taught R-based introductory statistics classes and currently serve as the Statistics Consultant for honors thesis students in the Harvard Psychology department, and as Concentration Advisor for Harvard undergraduates in Psychology. Additionally, I have an interest in science and technology policy and occasionally write about related topics.

I grew up in Chile, lived in Singapore for two years on a [United World College](https://www.uwc.org/) scholarship, and moved to the United States for college (Harvard College '16). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked in Harvard Professor Leah Somerville’s lab managing the Human Connectome Project in Development, a NIH-funded multimodal brain study charting age-related changes in brain network properties in children, adolescents, and adults.
