As we move through our daily lives, we must face a wide variety of stressors---from physical to social to work-related, each of which can influence our emotions and behavior in dynamic and idiosyncratic ways. The well-established relationship between stress and diverse pathologies shows that our response to the challenges of daily life can have an important impact on our long-term health and wellbeing. Yet so far we have been unable to characterize how the “wear-and-tear” of daily stressors on emotions and behavior unfolds dynamically over days, weeks, and months to subsequently predict clinical outcomes. 

For the first time, advances in mobile computing and the increasing ubiquity of wearable technology are making it possible to capture the multiple dimensions of daily life with great precision and near continuously. Seizing on this exciting opportunity, I have partnered with engineers, biostatisticians, and clinicians to translate the millions of continuous datapoints afforded by smartphones and wearables into year-long snapshots of an individual’s life. 

My doctoral research is leveraging this *deep phenotyping* approach to precisely characterize stress and its effects on various life domains that individuals typically must report retrospectively at the clinician’s office---from sleep patterns to daily activities, as well as how these effects go on to shape individuals’ long-term clinical outcomes. This work promises to not only advance our understanding of the impact of stress on individuals' health, but also to inform much-needed personalized and timely care.

**This innovative methodology is already yielding important insights into how emotions and behavior fluctuate in relation to stress and the possible implications for health and wellbeing**. Below are a few representative journal publications, posters with visual summaries, and general-audience features highlighting this research.

This year-long study measured actigraphy-derived sleep and activity, and daily self-reported metrics of mood, academic and social behavior in a group of 49 first-year college students. We found that participants' negative emotions, sleep patterns, and academic and social activity of varied substantially over the course of the year as well as between individuals. Cluster analysis identified three distinct student profiles with different affective and behavioral features, and varying levels of global psychological distress. While academics were a common stressor for all students, a vulnerable subgroup reporting greater frequency of social stressors went on to report the most psychological distress at the end of the year, suggesting dissociable effects of different stressors on mental health. We concluded that a focus on sustained interpersonal stress, relative to academic stress, might be especially helpful to identify students at heightened risk for psychopathology.


### [Within-Person Fluctuations in Stressful Life Events, Sleep, and Anxiety and Depression Symptoms During Adolescence: A Multi-Wave Prospective Study](https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13234)

This study leveraged a high-frequency longitudinal design to examine sleep as a potential mechanism linking stressful life events (SLEs) to increases in anxiety and depression symptoms over a one-year period. Thirty female adolescents aged 15–17 years completed 12 monthly in-laboratory assessments of exposure to SLEs and symptoms of anxiety and depression (n = 355 monthly assessments), and wore an actigraphy wristband for continuous monitoring of sleep for the duration of the study (n = 6,824 sleep days). We found that when adolescents experienced greater SLEs than was typical for them, they exhibited more variable sleep duration that same month as well as the following month. In turn, within-person increases in sleep duration variability predicted greater anxiety symptoms in the same month and mediated the association between SLEs and anxiety. These findings highlight sleep disruptions as a mechanism underlying the longitudinal associations between SLEs and anxiety symptoms, and suggest that interventions promoting sleep schedule consistency may help mitigate risk for stress-related psychopathology in adolescence.
