As we move through our daily lives, we must face a wide variety of stressors---from physical to social to work-related, each of which can influence our emotions and behavior in dynamic and idiosyncratic ways. The well-established relationship between stress and diverse pathologies shows that our response to the challenges of daily life can have an important impact on our long-term health and wellbeing. Yet so far we have been unable to characterize how the “wear-and-tear” of daily stressors on emotions and behavior unfolds dynamically over days, weeks, and months to subsequently predict clinical outcomes. 

For the first time, advances in mobile computing and the increasing ubiquity of wearable technology are making it possible to capture the multiple dimensions of daily life with great precision and near continuously. Seizing on this exciting opportunity, I have partnered with engineers, biostatisticians, and clinicians to translate the millions of continuous datapoints afforded by smartphones and wearables into year-long snapshots of an individual’s life. 

My doctoral research is leveraging this *deep phenotyping* approach to precisely characterize stress and its effects on various life domains that individuals typically must report retrospectively at the clinician’s office---from sleep patterns to daily activities, as well as how these effects go on to shape individuals’ long-term clinical outcomes. This work promises to not only advance our understanding of the impact of stress on individuals' health, but also to inform much-needed personalized and timely approaches to care.

This innovative methodology is already yielding critical insights into how emotions and behavior fluctuate in relation to stress and the possible implications for health and wellbeing. Below you will find a few representative journal publications as well as general-audience features of this research.


### [Fluctuations in Behavior and Affect in College Students Measured Using Deep Phenotyping](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05331-7)

This year-long study measured actigraphy-derived sleep and activity, and daily self-reported metrics of mood, academic and social behavior in a group of 49 first-year college students. We found that participants' negative emotions, sleep patterns, and academic and social activity of varied substantially over the course of the year as well as between individuals. Cluster analysis identified three distinct student profiles with different affective and behavioral features, and varying levels of global psychological distress. While academics were a common stressor for all students, a vulnerable subgroup reporting greater frequency of social stressors went on to report the most psychological distress at the end of the year, suggesting dissociable effects of different stressors on mental health. We concluded that a focus on sustained interpersonal stress, relative to academic stress, might be especially helpful to identify students at heightened risk for psychopathology.
