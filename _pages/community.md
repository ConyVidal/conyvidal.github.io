### [Health Resources and Recommendations for Harvard Graduate Students](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LunQipJ_az0aVDhpFXz79VSx_89vf_WcBPRjWn793tM/edit?usp=sharing)
*Updated August 2022*

Regardless of the severity, dealing with an emerging, pre-existing, and/or chronic health condition can be stressful and trigger a series of questions about where to get help and how this might affect your role as a graduate student. We hope that this document will help answer at least some of those questions. This document will point you to resources for getting access to medical care, covering healthcare costs, and obtaining accommodations for your various duties as a graduate student. Throughout, we have added recommendations for navigating these various resources and related conversations with advisors and instructors.
