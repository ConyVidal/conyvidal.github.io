### [Resources for Mentoring Young Investigators](https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/harvardpsychmentoring/){:target="_blank"}
*Updated August 2023*       

Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows are often left to improvise how to mentor young investigators, which can make the experience stressful and suboptimal for both the mentor and the mentee. We compiled the resources in the linked website to help trainees navigate their mentoring role smoothly and effectively. The site contains:

1. High-level mentoring recommendations and existing mentoring resources (for both mentors and mentees) at Harvard and beyond.               
2. Mentoring syllabus template to help mentors move from general recommendations to concrete and structured planning of their mentorship programming.          

3. Repository of workshop materials to help mentors organize skill-building workshops for mentees, from scientific literacy and communication to data science and professional development.

Regardless of the severity, dealing with an emerging, pre-existing, and/or chronic health condition can be stressful and trigger a series of questions about where to get help and how this might affect your role as a graduate student. We hope that this document will help answer at least some of those questions. This document points students to resources for getting access to medical care, covering healthcare costs, and obtaining accommodations for their various duties as a graduate student. Throughout, we have added recommendations for navigating these various resources and related conversations with advisors and instructors.
