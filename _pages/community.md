### [Health Resources and Recommendations for Harvard Graduate Students](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LunQipJ_az0aVDhpFXz79VSx_89vf_WcBPRjWn793tM/edit?usp=sharing)
*Updated August 2022*

Regardless of the severity, dealing with an emerging, pre-existing, and/or chronic health condition can be stressful and trigger a series of questions about where to get help and how this might affect your role as a graduate student. We hope that this document will help answer at least some of those questions. This document will point you to resources for getting access to medical care, covering healthcare costs, and obtaining accommodations for your various duties as a graduate student. Throughout, we have added recommendations for navigating these various resources and related conversations with advisors and instructors.


### [Resources for Mentoring Undergraduate and Full-Time Research Assistants](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19PwWjn6cViUboC2_oIRjX8QtV3OPpMuL)
*Updated September 2022*       

Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows are often left to improvise how to mentor young investigators, which can make the experience stressful and suboptimal for both the mentor and the mentee. We hope these resources will help! The folder has 3 components:

1. General Recommendations and Resources. This document provides brief, high-level mentoring recommendations and lists existing mentoring resources at Harvard and beyond.               

2. RA Syllabus Template. This is meant to help mentors move from general recommendations to concrete and structured planning of their mentorship programming.          

3. Repository of Workshop Materials. This will be a living repository of materials to help you organize skill-building workshops for your mentees, from scientific literacy, to programming, to preparing a CV. If you have any additional materials we can add, please send them along!
