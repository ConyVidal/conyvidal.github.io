Over the past few years, I have been fortunate to teach statistics and/or advise several dozen undergraduates in psychology and beyond. I am passionate about mentoring, and strive to support each one of my students as learners, researchers, and human beings, and to communicate complex content and skills while catering to their individual needs and interests whenever possible.
